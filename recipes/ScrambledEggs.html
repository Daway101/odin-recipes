        <h2 class="main">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="main">Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk eggs with salt until completely combined and very foamy.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over low heat until bubbling. Add whisked eggs; cook, stirring frequently for even,
                moist curds, until thickened and creamy, but still shiny, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove scrambled eggs from the pan before they begin to look dry, as they will continue to thicken off the
                heat.</li>
        </ol>
